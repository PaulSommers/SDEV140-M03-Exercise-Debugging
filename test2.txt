So, there is this snail, right? And one day, the snail decides he is tired of being slow. Everywhere he goes, people make fun of him for being so slow. They say things like, "Look at that snail! I could finish my lunch and take a nap before he gets anywhere!" He is pretty fed up.

Determined to change his life, the snail takes all his savings and goes to a car dealership. He walks in (well, snail-walks) and says, "I want the fastest car you have got! I am tired of being so slow!" The dealer, a bit surprised, shows him the fastest sports car on the lot. The snail takes a look and says, "It is perfect, but I need one adjustment. I want a giant letter S painted on the hood, the doors, and the roof!"

The dealer, puzzled, asks, "Why would you want that?"

The snail grins and replies, "Because when I speed down the road, I want people to say, Look at that S Car Go!"
